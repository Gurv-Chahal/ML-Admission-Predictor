# ML-Admission-Predictor
The goal of this project is to use python and machine learning to predict admission scores.

We used three different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminate Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors.
It predicted correctly above 90% of the time, and had above 90% precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy.

To predict admissions it used GPA, SAT score, # of Extra Cirriculars, SAT percentile, and academic score
